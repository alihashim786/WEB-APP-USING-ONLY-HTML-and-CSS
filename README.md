# Website Structure

For this project, I am designing the front end of a website consisting of 5 pages, using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The concept is inspired by websites like **eCommerce platforms** (similar to Amazon), **educational websites** (like Coursera), or **social media platforms** (such as Facebook or Instagram). However, the design will be **unique** and **creative**, avoiding direct copies of existing themes.

Feel free to explore similar websites for reference but use them only as inspiration. Your design should showcase your creativity and originality.

### Example Websites for Reference:
- [Daraz](https://www.daraz.pk/)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)
- [Coursera](https://classroom.google.com/h)

> **Note**: Do not follow the exact designs. Instead, add your own creative touch to differentiate your website.

## Instructions:

- Each page must contain **navigation links** to all other pages.
- Every page should include a **header** with the **logo** and the **name of the website**.
- A **footer** should be present on all pages, maintaining a consistent theme across the website.
  - The footer must include your **contact information** (phone number, email, address, social media links, etc.).

### Project Tools:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Bootstrap**

This project will demonstrate front-end web development skills with a focus on design, layout, and creativity.
